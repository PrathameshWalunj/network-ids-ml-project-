# Network Intrusion Detection System using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project implements a Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using machine learning techniques, specifically the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The goal is to detect various types of network attacks by analyzing network traffic patterns from the CICIDS2017 dataset.

## Features
- Data analysis and preprocessing of the CICIDS2017 dataset
- Implementation of KNN classifier for multi-class attack detection
- Basic packet inspection capabilities using Scapy
- Visualization of network traffic patterns and attack distributions

## Installation
To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/PrathameshWalunj/network-ids-ml-project.git
2. Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Dataset
This project uses the CICIDS2017 dataset, which includes:
- Benign network traffic
- Various attack types: DoS, DDoS, Brute Force, XSS, SQL Injection, Infiltration, Port Scan

To use the dataset:
1. Download it from: https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html
2. Place the CSV files in the `data/` directory

## Usage
1. Data Analysis and Model Training:
